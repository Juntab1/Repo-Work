Today I created that test file and it sort of worked. I was getting a chrome extension error in 
my console for the website so I figured out how to get rid of that error and now I have a test 
file with the code I need to save info. However, I am getting a 404 error meaning I messed
up somewhere so I have to figure it out tommorow.
