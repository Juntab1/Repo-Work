Today I met up with my group and tried to figure out the saving 
user input to a json file. However, after trying for more than 
a hour I could not figure it out. So, now we are going to go 
ask the tech team how to resolve the problem. However, I believe that
I know what the problem is but am not 100% sure. I also, figured out
the importance of a few lines of code and such so that was helpful to learn
on the way of solving this problem.
