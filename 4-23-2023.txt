I finished the about-page for my groups website.
I like how the page functions. 
I need to figure out how to fit 5 vertically though
because right now it only fits 3. Also, I need to play around
with the picture size, it looks blurry rn. Also, change 
color pattern at some point. Maybe you can change the shadow
pattern around every container too if you feel.
