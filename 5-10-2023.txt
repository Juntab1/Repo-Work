One of the other people in my group asked the tech team for help
and from reading the code added to the git repository it seems
that we need to use environments/node js. I do not fully understand
environments yet but it seems helpful when dividing up stages of a project
to make it so the users can't access or change all variables of your code
and also makes it easy to store data some times, for when a server is running?
