Today I met with my programming group to talk about our project. 
We are getting close to be done with a rough draft of out website.
We figured out a few problems we were having today with small things
with user data. I need to work on figuring out how to put info from 
users into our json file. However, other than that it is just cleaning 
up the website in general and connecting all the pages then we are done!
